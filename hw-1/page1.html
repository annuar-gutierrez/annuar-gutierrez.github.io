They must be able to recognise and identify potential projects risk and recommend steps to minimize and mitigate those risk. When planing, it is also important to plan into the future with to consider how this software will interact with other systems or other connecting softwares to ensure that everything properly works together. The most important thing when working with others would be to provide feedback and insight to not only to the manager of the software, but also to the other software engineers working on said or similar project as yours to reduce the risk of the software not being compatible with one another.</p>
